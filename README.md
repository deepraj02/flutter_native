## Limitations and Future Plans ðŸš€

iOS platform and other functionalitis in Android will be available in the future versions.  
### Future plans:

-  Add support for modifying iOS app permissions using the CLI.
-  Add support for adding signing keys for Android and iOS apps using the CLI.

-  Enhance CLI interface for better user experience.
-  Add support for modifying other Android and iOS configurations, such as adding entitlements for iOS apps and modifying Android manifest files.

-  Add support for modifying build settings for both Android and iOS apps using the CLI.
-  Improve documentation for the package and provide more examples and tutorials.

-  Add support for modifying app icons for both Android and iOS apps using the CLI.
-  Add support for modifying app names and descriptions for both Android and iOS apps using the CLI.
